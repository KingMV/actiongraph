# actiongraph
Action recognition based on action graph, which describes the spatio-temporal relationship between dense trajectory clusters. The program consists of three parts: 
1) Dense trajectory extraction based on Wang Heng's CVPR paper; 
2) Action graph construction; 
3) Video classification based on action recognition.
